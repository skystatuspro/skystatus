      "description": "Cost Per Mile (CPM) measures what you paid per mile acquired. Target under €0.012 for good value. Compare Subscribe to Miles (€0.0125), promo purchases (€0.016), and transfer partners.",
      "content": "Calculate it as: Total Cost ÷ Miles Received . A lower CPM is better. SkyStatus uses €0.012 as a practical benchmark: see how we estimate mile value . Above €0.015 usually only works with a clearly high-value redemption. On This Page The CPM Formula CPM Benchmarks CPM by Acquisition Method Transfer Partners: The Best Value Subscribe to Miles Promotional Purchases CPM vs Value Per Mile Weighted Average CPM FAQ Sources The CPM Formula CPM = Total Cost (€) ÷ Miles Received 📘 Example You buy 10,000 miles for €200. CPM = €200 ÷ 10,000 = €0.02 per mile This is above the €0.012 benchmark, so you need a redemption worth at least €0.02/mile to break even. CPM Benchmarks SkyStatus uses the following thresholds based on typical redemption values : CPM Range Verdict When It Makes Sense Under €0.008 🌟 Excellent Transfer bonuses, credit card earning on spend you would make anyway €0.008 to 0.012 ✅ Good Standard transfers, flight earning, some promotional purchases €0.012 to 0.015 ⚠️ Fair Subscribe to Miles, topping off for a specific redemption €0.015 to 0.02 ⚠️ Marginal Only for high-value Business Class redemptions Above €0.02 ❌ Poor Almost never worth it; consider paying cash instead CPM by Acquisition Method Method Typical CPM Notes Transfer partners (with bonus) €0.006 to 0.008 ✅ Best option when 25%+ bonus available Transfer partners (standard) €0.008 to 0.01 ✅ Excellent if you earn points on regular spending Flying (implicit cost) ~€0.01 ✅ Part of your ticket cost; not incremental spend Subscribe to Miles €0.0125 ⚠️ Best for small top-ups; cancellable Promo purchase (80% bonus) €0.016 ⚠️ Only for specific high-value redemptions Promo purchase (45% discount) €0.016 ⚠️ Similar to bonus promos Standard purchase €0.028 ❌ Almost never worth it Transfer Partners: The Best Value The most cost-effective way to acquire Flying Blue miles is through credit card transfer partners. If you earn points on spending you would do anyway, your effective CPM approaches zero. Official list of partners and conversion options: Flying Blue partner conversions . Flying Blue transfer partners American Express Membership Rewards Chase Ultimate Rewards Citi ThankYou Points Capital One Miles Bilt Rewards Wells Fargo Rewards Transfer bonuses of 20 to 30% happen several times per year. A 25% bonus means 100,000 credit card points become 125,000 Flying Blue miles. Ratios may vary by partner and region. 📊 Transfer Bonus Example You earn 50,000 Amex points on €25,000 credit card spend (2x earning rate). Transfer during 25% bonus: 50,000 → 62,500 Flying Blue miles. If you value the Amex points at €0.01 each: CPM = €500 ÷ 62,500 = €0.008/mile This is excellent value, well below the €0.012 benchmark. 💡 Strategy: Never transfer points speculatively. Wait until you have a specific redemption in mind and award availability confirmed. Then check if a transfer bonus is active. If not, evaluate whether the redemption value justifies the standard transfer. Subscribe to Miles Flying Blue offers a monthly subscription service called \"Subscribe to Miles\" where you pay a fixed monthly fee for a set number of miles. Official overview: Introducing Subscribe to Miles . Manage subscription: Subscribe to Miles portal . Package Miles per Month Price (USD) CPM (USD) CPM (EUR approx.) Starter 2,000 $39.80 1.99¢ €0.0185 Smart 5,000 $89.80 1.80¢ €0.0167 Advanced 10,000 $159.80 1.60¢ €0.0149 Complete 17,000 $227.80 1.34¢ €0.0125 Subscribe to Miles: Key Details Cancellation and refund rules depend on your checkout terms and country Miles validity is governed by the Flying Blue programme terms Posting timing can vary after payment Plan changes may be restricted depending on subscription terms Miles do NOT count toward XP or status The Complete package at 1.34¢ USD (approximately €0.0125) is close to typical redemption values of €0.012. This makes it useful for topping off your balance for a specific redemption, but not for speculative accumulation. 💡 When Subscribe to Miles Makes Sense: You are 15,000 miles short of a Business Class redemption worth €0.025/mile. Subscribe for one month at the Complete tier (17,000 miles for $227.80), book your award, then cancel. Your CPM is €0.0125, but your redemption value is €0.025. That is a 2x return. Promotional Purchases Flying Blue runs promotional purchase offers several times per year, typically offering 50 to 100% bonus miles or 35 to 45% discounts. Promotion Type Effective CPM (USD) Effective CPM (EUR) Frequency 100% bonus (best ever) 1.53¢ €0.0142 Rare, last seen 2022 80% bonus (current Dec 2025) 1.69¢ €0.0157 Several times per year 45% discount 1.68¢ €0.0156 Several times per year 50% bonus 2.03¢ €0.0189 Common Standard (no promo) 3.05¢ €0.0284 Always available ⚠️ Standard Purchases Are Almost Never Worth It: At €0.028 per mile, you are paying more than double the benchmark. Even with an 80% bonus, you need a redemption worth at least €0.016/mile to break even. Always have a specific high-value redemption in mind before ",

      "description": "The complete guide to Flying Blue Gold. Master the 180 XP requirement (after Silver!), calculate your ROI, and use smart strategies to unlock worldwide lounge access.",
      "content": "When you qualify for Silver, 100 XP is deducted and your balance resets. Gold therefore requires a total earning effort of 280 XP from zero. Gold unlocks SkyTeam lounge access with one guest. Source . On This Page How to Reach 180 XP Understanding Your Qualification Year Why Gold is the \"Sweet Spot\" Is Gold Worth the Investment? Strategies to Reach 180 XP XP Accelerators Maintaining Gold FAQ Sources The Rules: How to Reach 180 XP Many new members underestimate the path to Gold. It is not a straight climb to 180 XP total. The program works in steps where you \"pay\" XP to unlock each level. Step 1: The Silver Hurdle Starting as an Explorer (0 XP), your first target is Silver. Goal: Reach 100 XP . The Event: The moment you hit 100 XP, you become Silver. The Cost: 100 XP is immediately deducted (\"paid\") from your balance. The Reset: Your qualification year resets to the 1st of the next month. Step 2: The Climb to Gold Now that you are Silver, you start fresh toward Gold. Goal: Reach 180 XP (within your new qualification year). Note: The 100 XP you earned for Silver is gone. You build this 180 XP from your new balance. Total Effort: From zero to Gold requires effectively 280 XP (100 for Silver + 180 for Gold) in a continuous run. 📊 Calculation Example Situation: You have 90 XP. You fly a trip earning 30 XP. Total hits 120 XP. Silver is triggered. Cost: 100 XP. New Balance: 20 XP. To reach Gold: You need 160 more XP (Target 180 minus Balance 20). Understanding Your Qualification Year Your qualification year is personal to you. Understanding its structure is essential for status planning. Qualification Year Structure Format: Always runs from the 1st of a month to the last day of the month before, one year later (e.g., November 1 to October 31). Determined by: Your last level-up to your current XP status. Requalification: If you maintain your status (not level up), your year dates stay exactly the same. Level-up reset: If you reach a higher status mid-year, your qualification year resets to the 1st of the next month. Source . 📊 Level-Up Example Situation: Your Silver year runs until October 31. On May 3, you hit 180 XP. You immediately become Gold. 180 XP is deducted from your balance. Your new Gold year runs June 1 to May 31. Why Gold is the \"Sweet Spot\" Gold status unlocks the single most valuable airline benefit for many travelers: lounge access . Here is why Gold offers the best return on effort compared to Silver . Benefit Silver Gold Value Jump Lounge Access No ✅ All SkyTeam lounges (+1 guest) Huge Value Miles Earning 6 Miles per euro 7 Miles per euro +17% SkyPriority Check-in/Boarding Check-in/Boarding/Baggage Faster bags Economy Comfort seat ❌ Free 72h before Better seats Discount Options 25% off 50% off Double savings 💡 Lounge Access Details: Gold members get access to 750+ SkyTeam lounges when flying internationally on SkyTeam-operated flights. Your guest must be on the same flight. Since April 2025, domestic lounge access is available at select airports. Is Gold Worth the Investment? Before you start a mileage run , calculate your personal ROI. Gold typically delivers 600 to 1,050 euros in annual value for moderate travelers. Lounge visits: 15 visits x 40 euros value = 600 euros. Extra baggage: 4 flights x 50 euros = 200 euros. Priority & Comfort: Estimated 200 euros in time saved and comfort. Strategies to Reach 180 XP Once you are Silver, how do you get those 180 XP efficiently? Choose the strategy that fits your budget. Check our XP earning chart for current rates. Strategy 1: The Positioning Flight (Fastest) The Strategy: Never fly direct if you want status. Adding a segment increases your XP significantly because XP is calculated per leg . Direct: AMS to New York (Business) = 30 XP one way. Connected: AMS to Paris to New York (Business) = 15 XP + 30 XP = 45 XP one way. By adding a connection, you earn 50% more XP for roughly the same price. This is a classic mileage run tactic. Strategy 2: Business Class Sprint (Efficiency) The Strategy: Long-haul Business Class is the XP engine. Distance and cabin multipliers work in your favor. AMS to New York (JFK) in Business: 60 XP return. AMS to Tokyo (NRT) in Business: 72 XP return. The Math: Just 3 long-haul Business trips (3 x 60 = 180 XP) will take you from Silver to Gold immediately. Strategy 3: The Economy Grind (Budget) The Strategy: Maximize XP per euro by flying Economy on longer routes with competitive pricing. You can significantly reduce the number of trips needed by booking smart connections. The \"Expert\" Method: Just like with Business Class, adding a connection boosts your Economy XP earnings by 50% per trip. Direct: AMS to New York (Economy) = 20 XP return (10 XP x 2 legs). Via Paris: AMS to Paris (5 XP) + Paris to New York (10 XP) = 30 XP return . Expert Tip (The \"Antwerp Run\"): Starting your journey from Antwerp (ZWE) or Brussels often lowers the ticket price and adds a \"flight\" segment. The train ride to Amsterdam counts as a flight segmen",

The baseline valuation most analysts use is €0.012 per mile (approximately 1.2 to 1.3 US cents) based on industry benchmarks from TPG and NerdWallet . This is achievable with a mix of redemption types. Short answer A Flying Blue mile is typically worth €0.01 to 0.02 . Business Class and Promo Rewards deliver the highest value. Economy and non-flight redemptions are usually poor value. Values of €0.04+ per mile are outliers , not the average. 📢 January 2025 Update: Flying Blue increased award prices.

If cash fares are €3,000 and you pay 60,000 miles, you are getting €0.05 per mile, four times the baseline value. Note: These are outliers , not typical redemptions. Promo Rewards: 25 to 50% Off Every month, Flying Blue publishes Promo Rewards offering 25 to 50% off award prices on select routes. This is one of the best ways to maximize mile value.

Some Business Class deals are only visible to subscribers. How to Earn Miles: Transfer Partners You do not need to fly Air France or KLM to earn Flying Blue miles.

Platinum unlocks free seat selection at booking, the Platinum Service Line, and access to earning UXP toward Ultimate status .

Beyond the status symbol, Platinum unlocks tangible financial and comfort benefits that Gold does not offer. See the official KLM membership levels page for the full list. Platinum Service Line (24/7): Access to dedicated support agents, including during disruptions. See official tier benefits . Free Preferred Seats: Select Economy Comfort, Exit Row, or Front Section seats for free at the time of booking. ( Gold members get free seat selection 72h before departure.) Enhanced Baggage Allowance: On SkyTeam partner flights: +1 extra bag. On Air France & KLM flights: +2 extra bags (a significant AF/KL-specific benefit). Lounge Access: Access to SkyTeam lounges worldwide for you + 1 guest (must be traveling on the same flight operated by a SkyTeam carrier). SkyPriority: Priority at every step: check-in, baggage drop, security (where available), boarding, and baggage delivery. Platinum for Life: After 10 consecutive years of Platinum, you keep the status permanently, regardless of your XP. See tier benefits for details. 💡 Remco's Tip: The \"Free Preferred Seats\" benefit is often undervalued. On a long-haul return trip to Asia or the US, selecting an Exit Row or Economy Comfort seat can normally cost €150-200. As a Platinum member, you save this immediately upon booking. 💡 Edge Cases: Specific benefits like lounge access depend on the operating carrier (SkyTeam members). Baggage rules vary by route and fare class. Always check your booking confirmation for what's included on your specific itinerary.

Understanding its structure is essential for status planning. See qualification year guide for full details, or the official status page . Qualification Year Structure Format: Always runs from the 1st of a month to the last day of the month before, one year later (e.g., November 1 to October 31). Determined by: Your last level-up to your current XP status. Requalification: If you maintain your status (not level up), your qualification year dates stay exactly the same. Level-up: If you reach a higher status mid-year, your qualification year resets to the 1st of the next month. 1. Level Up: Going from Gold to Platinum As soon as your XP balance hits 300 XP, you are upgraded immediately. 300 XP is deducted (\"paid\") from your balance. Your qualification year resets. Your new year starts on the 1st of the following month. Example: You hit 300 XP on May 3rd. You become Platinum. Your new qualification year runs June 1st to May 31st. 2. Maintain: Staying Platinum If you are already Platinum, your qualification year remains fixed. At the end of your year, the system checks if you have at least 300 XP. If yes: 300 XP is deducted to renew Platinum for another year. Remaining XP (up to 300) rolls over . If no: You experience a \"soft landing\" to Gold. Strategies to Reach 300 XP Reaching 300 XP requires a significant amount of flying. Since there is no \"status bonus\" for earning XP (you earn the same XP as an Explorer for the same flight), you rely on volume or cabin class. Strategy 1: Segment Maximization The Strategy: Fly routes with a connection (e.g., AMS-CDG-NCE) instead of direct. Each leg earns XP. This is a classic mileage run technique . Direct AMS-NCE (Business): ~30 XP return. Connected AMS-CDG-NCE (Business): ~60 XP return. Result: 5 of these connected trips per year ≈ 300 XP. You are Platinum. Note: Always compare total time, cost, and disruption risk. Connections can backfire during IRROPS. Strategy 2: The Long-Haul Business Strategy The Strategy: Focus your bud",

It launched in late 2024 and offers the best cost per mile compared to standard purchases. ✅ Best for Topping Off Subscribe to Miles Tiers Package Miles/Month Price (USD) Cost Per Mile Starter 2,000 $39.80 1.99¢ (€0.0185) Smart 5,000 $89.80 1.80¢ (€0.0167) Advanced 10,000 $159.80 1.60¢ (€0.0149) Complete 17,000 $227.80 1.34¢ (€0.0125) Prices in USD. EUR equivalents approximate at current exchange rates. Subscribe to Miles: Key Details Cancel anytime (withdrawal right within 14 working days, see official terms ) Miles deposited within 72 hours of payment Miles never expire while subscription is active (see miles expiration rules ) Cannot pause, upgrade, or downgrade mid-month Does NOT include any XP toward status Processed through Points.com (does not code as travel) 💡 Edge Cases: FX fluctuations can affect your effective cost per mile. Purchases through Points.com may not code as travel for credit card rewards. Devaluation risk: miles can lose value if Flying Blue changes award pricing. ⚠️ Common Misconception: Subscribe to Miles does NOT give you any XP. You cannot earn status through this subscription. It only provides award miles for redemptions. If you want XP, you need to fly or purchase Flying Blue Extra Extended. When Subscribe to Miles Makes Sense ✅ Good Scenario: Topping Off for a Redemption You have 45,000 miles and want to book a Business Class award requiring 60,000 miles. Subscribe to Complete tier for one month: 17,000 miles for $227.80 (€212) Book your award, then cancel the subscription. Your cost per mile : €0.0125. If the redemption value is €0.025/mile , you doubled your money. ❌ Bad Scenario: Speculative Accumulation Subscribing for 12 months \"just in case\" means spending $2,733.60 (€2,540) for 204,000 miles. If you do not have a specific redemption planned, you are locking up capital in a currency that can devalue overnight. Transfer partners often offer better value, especially during bonus periods. Subscribe to Miles vs Other Acquisition Methods Method Cost Per Mile Verdict Transfer (25% bonus) ~€0.008 Best if you have points Transfer (standard) ~€0.01 Usually better than Subscribe Subscribe to Miles (Complete) €0.0125 Good for topping off Promo purchase (80% bonus) €0.016 Slightly worse than Subscribe Standard purchase €0.028 Almost never worth it For more on these comparisons, see our Should You Buy Flying Blue Miles? guide. Flying Blue Extra: Premium Annual Subscription Flying Blue Extra launched in November 2025 as a premium subscription offering perks like exclusive Promo Rewards and bonus XP. It comes in two tiers: Essential (€379/year) and Extended (€699/year). ⚠️ Industry Reception: Flying Blue Extra has received mixed reviews in the frequent flyer community.

      "content": "Home / Guides / Ultimate Status Highest Tier Flying Blue Ultimate: The Technical Guide Last updated: 19 December 2025 · 14 min read · Based on official Flying Blue program rules · See sources Official sources used for verification: Flying Blue: Ultimate info · KLM: Membership levels · Flying Blue: Status & XP R By Remco Flying Blue Platinum · 20 years in the program Short answer: To reach Flying Blue Ultimate , you must hold Platinum status and earn 900 UXP within one qualification year . UXP is earned only on AF or KL marketed flights and is calculated separately from XP. On This Page 1. XP vs UXP: The Two Point Systems 2. The UXP \"Payment\" Mechanic 3. The Qualification Year 4. UXP Caps and Limits 5. Status Protection: The Real Math 6. Strategies to Reach 900 UXP 7. Ultimate Benefits vs Platinum What is Ultimate? Flying Blue Ultimate is not a separate XP level like Gold or Silver. It is a prestigious status layer added on top of Platinum . While XP determines your base status, UXP (Ultimate XP) determines if you unlock this top tier. The Golden Rule: To be Ultimate, you must be Platinum AND have earned 900 UXP within your current qualification year ( official KLM reference ). When you qualify, 900 UXP is deducted from your balance. 1. The Two Point Systems: XP vs UXP To understand Ultimate, you must understand the two parallel counters running in your account. Feature Standard XP UXP Purpose Determines Explorer to Platinum Determines Ultimate eligibility Sources All SkyTeam partners , Transavia, AMEX Only AF/KL marketed flights + SAF on AF/KL ( official ) Relationship Every UXP is also XP Not every XP is UXP Payment 100/180/300 XP deducted for status 900 UXP deducted for Ultimate Rollover Cap Max 300 XP. See Rollover Rules . Max 900 UXP ⚠️ Marketing Carrier Matters: UXP is earned only on flights marketed by Air France (AF) or KLM (KL) ( official Flying Blue Ultimate rules ). A flight operated by KLM but booked with a Delta flight number (DL9600) earns zero UXP . Always check the flight code on your ticket. 💡 Edge Cases: Codeshares can be confusing. The rule is simple: look at the flight number on your ticket. If it starts with AF or KL, you earn UXP. Transavia flights never earn UXP, even when booked via KLM. Partner bookings via the AF/KL website still depend on the flight number, not the booking channel. 2. The UXP \"Payment\" Mechanic Just like XP, UXP follows a \"payment\" system when you achieve or maintain Ultimate status. How UXP Payment Works Step 1: Check if you are Platinum AND have at least 900 UXP. Step 2: When you qualify for Ultimate, 900 UXP is deducted from your balance ( official KLM reference ). Step 3: Calculate your UXP rollover from the remaining balance. Step 4: Cap the rollover at 900 UXP maximum. UXP Rollover = min(UXP Balance - 900, 900) 💡 Double Payment: As an Ultimate member, you pay twice at year end: 300 XP for Platinum AND 900 UXP for Ultimate ( Air France official ). These are independent calculations. You can roll over up to 300 XP AND up to 900 UXP simultaneously. 3. The Qualification Year Your UXP counter is tied to your personal qualification year. Understanding this is crucial for planning. Key Rules Structure: Runs from the 1st of a month to the last day of the month before, one year later (e.g., November 1 to October 31). Official reference: Flying Blue Status & XP . Determined by: Your last level-up to your current XP status. UXP follows XP: Your UXP counter is tied to the same qualification year. UXP always counts: Even before you reach Platinum, your UXP accumulates. ⚠️ Level-Up Resets Your UXP Counter: If you level up from Gold to Platinum mid-year, your qualification year resets to the 1st of the next month. Your UXP counter also resets (with rollover up to 900). You then have 12 months to accumulate 900 UXP for Ultimate. 💡 Ultimate Does NOT Reset Your Year: Unlike Silver, Gold, and Platinum, reaching Ultimate does not trigger a new qualification year. Ultimate is a status layer on top of Platinum, not a separate XP level. Your qualification year remains unchanged when you achieve Ultimate. 4. UXP Caps and Limits The Practical UXP Planning Limit For planning purposes, Ultimate follows a simple structure: 900 UXP is required to qualify, and up to 900 additional UXP can strengthen your rollover into the next qualification year. In practice: First 900 UXP: Required to qualify for Ultimate (deducted upon qualification). Next 900 UXP: Can roll over to the next year. Above this: Additional UXP provides no extra benefit for Ultimate planning (though it still counts as regular XP for Platinum maintenance). Rollover rule: \"you will keep the rest (900 UXP maximum)\". Source: KLM membership levels . 📊 Scenario: Maximum Rollover Strategy Situation: You are Ultimate and earn 1,800 UXP this year. Calculation: UXP Balance: 1,800 UXP Ultimate cost: 900 UXP deducted Remainder: 1,800 - 900 = 900 UXP Rollover cap: 900 UXP (exactly at cap) Result: You start next year with 900 UXP . Yo",

On This Page XP vs UXP: The Two Point Systems UXP Always Counts (Even Without Platinum) Which Flights Earn UXP? The UXP \"Payment\" Mechanic Qualification Year and UXP UXP Caps and Limits Ultimate Status Requirements Strategies for Earning UXP Tracking Your UXP FAQ Definition: Marketing Carrier is Key UXP (Ultimate XP) is the metric used exclusively to qualify for Flying Blue Ultimate status . The golden rule: UXP is earned on flights marketed by Air France (AF) or KLM (KL) ( official Flying Blue Ultimate info ). This means the two-letter code on your ticket must be AF or KL, regardless of which airline actually flies the plane (the operating carrier). Partner flights marketed by Delta, Kenya Airways, or others earn regular XP but zero UXP. The Two Point Systems: XP vs UXP Flying Blue operates two parallel point systems. Understanding the difference is critical for anyone pursuing Ultimate status. Aspect Regular XP UXP (Ultimate XP) Purpose Determines Explorer to Platinum Required for Ultimate status Sources All SkyTeam partners , Transavia, AMEX cards Only AF/KL marketed flights + SAF on AF/KL ( official ) Relationship Includes all UXP Every UXP is also XP Threshold 100 / 180 / 300 for status levels 900 UXP for Ultimate ( official KLM ) Payment Deducted at status transition 900 UXP deducted for Ultimate Rollover Cap 300 XP maximum 900 UXP maximum ⚠️ The \"Marketing Carrier\" Trap: Do not look at the aircraft livery; look at your ticket. A flight operated by KLM but booked with a Delta flight number (e.g., DL9600) earns zero UXP . Conversely, a flight operated by Delta but booked with a KLM flight number (e.g., KL6000) does earn UXP . The flight code on your ticket is the deciding factor. UXP Always Counts (Even Without Platinum) A common misconception is that UXP only starts counting once you reach Platinum. This is wrong. 💡 Key Insight: Your UXP counter accumulates from the moment you join Flying Blue, regardless of your status level. Every AF/KL marketed flight adds to your UXP balance. However, UXP only becomes relevant for Ultimate qualification once you are Platinum. This has an important implication: if you level up to Platinum mid-year, your UXP counter resets (with rollover ) just like your XP counter. Plan accordingly. Which Flights Earn UXP? ✅ Earns UXP AF coded flights: E.g., AF1234 (even if operated by Delta, Virgin Atlantic, or partners) KL coded flights: E.g., KL5678 (even if operated by Delta, Kenya Airways, or partners) SAF purchases: Sustainable Aviation Fuel contributions on AF/KL tickets ❌ Does NOT Earn UXP (Regular XP Only) Delta coded flights (DL...) Korean Air, Vietnam Airlines, China Airlines, Garuda coded flights Transavia flights (even if booked via KLM) Flying Blue AMEX card annual XP bonuses Promotional XP (unless explicitly stated otherwise) 💡 Edge Cases: Codeshare flights can be confusing. The rule is simple: look at the flight number on your ticket. If it starts with AF or KL, you earn UXP. If it starts with anything else (DL, KE, VN, etc.), you earn XP only. When booking partner-operated flights, always select the AF/KL marketed option if available. 📊 Scenario: The Codeshare Difference You fly New York to Amsterdam on a KLM aircraft (blue livery). Ticket KL642: You earn XP + UXP ✅ Ticket DL9642: You earn regular XP only ❌ Insider Tip: Always book the \"Marketed by KLM/Air France\" option on the website to ensure UXP earnings. The UXP \"Payment\" Mechanic Just like XP, UXP follows a \"payment\" system. When you achieve or maintain Ultimate status, points are deducted from your balance. How UXP Payment Works Step 1: Check if you have at least 900 UXP AND are Platinum. Step 2: When you qualify for Ultimate, 900 UXP is deducted from your balance. Step 3: Calculate your UXP rollover from the remaining balance. Step 4: Cap the rollover at 900 UXP maximum. This is the same \"payment\" logic that applies to XP for Silver (100), Gold (180), and Platinum (300). UXP Rollover = min(UXP Balance - 900, 900) 💡 Double Payment for Ultimate: As an Ultimate member, you pay twice at the end of your qualification year: 300 XP for Platinum maintenance AND 900 UXP for Ultimate. These are calculated independently. You can roll over up to 300 XP AND up to 900 UXP simultaneously. The Qualification Year and UXP UXP is tied to your personal qualification year.

      "content": "When you earn more XP than needed to maintain your status, the surplus rolls over. This is capped at 300 XP maximum . For Ultimate members , up to 900 UXP can also roll over separately. Official reference: KLM membership levels (\"you'll keep the rest\" after XP deduction). The Core Mechanic: \"Paying\" for Status Before you understand rollover, you must understand how Flying Blue handles status transitions. When your qualification year ends (or you level up), the system does not just \"keep\" your status. It deducts points from your balance as \"payment\" for your new or renewed status. How Status Payment Works At every status transition, the system performs a calculation: Step 1: Check if you have enough XP to qualify for your target status. Step 2: Deduct the required XP from your balance (100 for Silver, 180 for Gold, 300 for Platinum). Step 3: Calculate your rollover from the remaining XP (capped at 300 XP). Step 4: Start your new qualification year with the rollover amount. This \"payment\" mechanic is why you do not simply reach 180 XP total to go from Explorer to Gold. You must first \"pay\" 100 XP for Silver, then earn 180 XP fresh for Gold. Your counter resets at each tier upgrade. For more on how XP works: What is Flying Blue XP? How UXP Payment Works (Ultimate) UXP follows the same \"payment\" logic as XP, but for Ultimate status : Step 1: Check if you have at least 900 UXP AND are Platinum. Step 2: When you qualify for Ultimate, 900 UXP is deducted from your UXP balance. Step 3: Calculate your UXP rollover from the remaining balance (capped at 900 UXP). Step 4: Start your new qualification year with the UXP rollover amount. Important: Ultimate is not an XP status level. It is a layer on top of Platinum. In practice, reaching Ultimate typically does not reset your qualification year. Official reference: Flying Blue Ultimate . The Rollover Formulas XP Rollover = min(XP Balance - Status Cost, 300) UXP Rollover = min(UXP Balance - 900, 900) In plain terms: your rollover equals your total points minus what you \"paid\" for status, capped at the maximum allowed. Any points above the cap are lost. Official rule: \"surplus XP (up to 300 XP) will be yours to keep\" — KLM membership levels . Last verified: 19 December 2025. Rollover Caps by Status Level The rollover cap applies the same way at all status levels : Status XP Cost Max XP Rollover UXP Cost Max UXP Rollover Silver 100 XP 300 XP N/A N/A Gold 180 XP 300 XP N/A N/A Platinum 300 XP 300 XP N/A N/A Ultimate 300 XP 300 XP 900 UXP 900 UXP 💡 Key Insight: Ultimate members pay twice: 300 XP for Platinum maintenance AND 900 UXP for Ultimate. These are independent calculations. You can roll over up to 300 XP AND up to 900 UXP simultaneously. ⚠️ The 300 XP Cap is Absolute: Even if you are Ultimate and earn 800 XP in a year, you can only roll over 300 XP (after paying 300 for Platinum maintenance). The remaining 200 XP is \"wasted\" for rollover purposes. Plan your flying accordingly. Understanding Your Qualification Year Your qualification year is personal to you. It does not follow the calendar year. Understanding when it starts and ends is essential for rollover planning. How Your Qualification Year Works Structure: Always runs from the first day of a month to the last day of the month before, one year later (e.g., November 1 to October 31). Official reference: Flying Blue Status & XP . Determined by: Your last level up to your current XP status. Two triggers for a new year: Requalification (year stays same) or Level up (year resets). Trigger 1: Requalification (Same Level) Your qualification year ends naturally. You have met the XP threshold for your current status. The system deducts the cost, calculates rollover, and your qualification year dates stay exactly the same. 📊 Requalification Example Situation: Your Platinum year runs November 1 to October 31. You earn 400 XP by October 31. What happens: You requalify as Platinum (400 >= 300) 300 XP is deducted 100 XP rolls over Your new year is again November 1 to October 31 Trigger 2: Level Up (Status Upgrade) You earn enough XP mid cycle to reach the next status level. Your cycle immediately resets to the first day of the following month. The Level Up Reset Mechanic Instant Upgrade: The moment you cross a threshold (e.g., 180 XP for Gold), you are upgraded immediately. Cycle Reset: Your qualification year resets to the 1st of the next month. XP Deduction: The cost for your new status is deducted from your balance. Rollover Calculation: Any remaining XP becomes your starting balance. 📊 Level Up Example Situation: You are Gold. Your year runs until October 31. On May 3, you reach 300 XP. What happens: You immediately become Platinum 300 XP is deducted (300 - 300 = 0 XP) Your new Platinum year runs June 1 to May 31 You start with 0 XP ⚠️ Ultimate Does NOT Reset Your Year: Unlike Silver, Gold, and Platinum, reaching Ultimate does not trigger a new qualification year. Ultimate is a status layer on top of Platinum, not a separ",

When you reach a status threshold, the required XP is deducted from your balance. Surplus XP (up to 300) rolls over to your next qualification year. This is why reaching Gold from Explorer requires 280 XP total (100 for Silver + 180 for Gold), not just 180 XP. 📚 Understanding XP and Status Start Here What is Flying Blue XP? How XP is earned based on cabin class and distance. Understand the \"payment\" system and why you cannot skip status levels. Status Levels Compared Silver, Gold, Platinum, Ultimate: XP thresholds, benefits at each tier, and which level offers the best value for your travel pattern. Important How XP Rollover Works Up to 300 XP can roll over after paying for status. Learn the formulas, caps, and strategies to maximize rollover value. What is UXP (Ultimate XP)? UXP is earned only on AF/KL marketed flights. Required for Ultimate status. 900 UXP is deducted when you qualify. 🎯 Reaching Status Goals Sweet Spot How to Reach Gold Status Gold (180 XP) unlocks lounge access. First clear the Silver hurdle (100 XP), then earn 180 XP fresh. Strategies for efficient earning. How to Reach Platinum Platinum (300 XP) unlocks upgrade eligibility and starts your UXP counter toward Ultimate. High volume strategies explained. Top Tier Ultimate Status Guide Requires Platinum + 900 UXP. Both are deducted upon qualification. Ultimate does not reset your qualification year. Special soft landing rules apply. 💡 Qualification Year: Your 12-month cycle runs from the 1st of a month to the last day of the month before, one year later (e.g., November 1 to October 31). A level-up resets your year to the 1st of the next month. Requalification at the same level keeps your dates unchanged. Ultimate does not trigger a reset. ✈️ XP Runs (Mileage Runs) What is an XP Run? Flights taken primarily for status points. Why adding a connection can increase your XP by 50% for the same price. Tool Mileage Run Calculator Find the best routes by cost per XP from Amsterdam, Paris, and other hubs. Compare Economy vs Business efficiency. 💰 Miles Value and Acquisition What Are Miles Worth? Typically 0.012 to 0.02 euros per mile depending on redemption. Business Class awards offer the best value per mile. Should You Buy Miles? At 0.025+ euros per mile, buying rarely makes sense. Only consider when Promo Rewards align with your travel plans. Best Value Subscribe to Miles Worth It? At roughly 0.011 euros per mile, subscriptions offer the best acquisition rate. Note: this earns Miles, not XP for status. Cost Per Mile Explained How to calculate CPM and optimize your miles acquisition strategy across different sources. 🛠️ Practical Guides Import Your Flying Blue PDF Step by step guide to importing your activity statement. Works with Dutch, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, and English. Partner Airlines List All SkyTeam partners earn XP when credited to Flying Blue. Only flights marketed by AF or KL (the flight code on your ticket) earn UXP. 🔑 Key Concepts at a Glance XP vs Miles XP determines your status level (Silver to Platinum). Miles are a currency you spend on awards. They are earned together but serve different purposes. XP vs UXP XP is earned on all qualifying flights. UXP is earned only on AF/KL marketed flights and is required (on top of Platinum) for Ultimate status. Soft Landing You can only drop one status level per year, even with 0 XP earned. Ultimate members always soft land to Platinum first, never directly to Gold. Rollover Caps Maximum 300 XP and 900 UXP can roll over. Anything above these caps after paying for status is lost.

      "content": "Business Class on short European routes often offers the best €/XP ratio. From Amsterdam, routes like AMS-Barcelona Business (~€350, 30-48 XP return depending on exact routing) are consistently good value. Step-by-Step Mileage Run Planning Step 1: Calculate Your XP Gap Determine exactly how many XP you need: Check current XP on FlyingBlue.com Know your target threshold (Silver 100, Gold 180, Platinum 300) Subtract: Threshold - Current XP = Gap Factor in upcoming regular flights Step 2: Set Your Budget What's status worth to you? Gold annual value: ~€600-1,000 Typical mileage run budget: €200-800 Calculate break-even: Budget ÷ Annual Value = Years Step 3: Find Routes Search for flights with the best €/XP ratio. Use the route tables below as starting points, then check current prices on KLM.com and AirFrance.com. 💡 Important: Unlike Award Miles, XP earnings are NOT multiplied by your status . A Platinum member earns the same XP for a flight as an Explorer member. Do not apply any status multiplier to your XP calculations. Best Routes from Amsterdam (AMS) XP values are estimates for a round-trip. \"Biz\" = Business Class.

A direct return in Business is 30 XP. A connecting return is 60 XP. Timing Your Booking Best Days to Fly Tuesday-Thursday: Cheapest fares, emptiest flights Early morning/late evening: Less popular = lower prices Avoid: Friday evening, Sunday evening (business traveler peaks) Best Time to Book 3-6 weeks before: Optimal pricing window Sales: Watch for Flying Blue promotions (often in Jan, Black Friday) Last minute: Rarely good for mileage runs (high prices) Sample Mileage Run Plans 📊 Plan A: Silver → Gold (Need 80 XP) Budget: ~€900-1,200 Option 1: Two Business Class trips with connections • Example: AMS-CDG-NCE return in Business • 15 XP per leg x 4 legs = 60 XP per trip • 2 trips x 60 XP = 120 XP ✅ • Cost: ~€500 per trip = €1,000 total 📊 Plan B: Gold Maintenance (Need 180 XP) Budget: ~€1,500-2,000 Option: Three Business Class trips with connections • 3 trips x 60 XP each = 180 XP ✅ • Focus on cheaper European routes (Billund, Nice, Berlin) • Spaced out over the year: €500-600 per trip Common Mistakes to Avoid Expecting a status bonus: Remember, you do NOT get extra XP for being Silver/Gold. Math is the same for everyone.

      "description": "Usually no. Buying Flying Blue miles costs €0.016-0.028/mile depending on promos. Only buy for specific Business Class redemptions worth €0.02+/mile. Transfer partners and Subscribe to Miles are usually better.",
      "content": "Standard purchases cost €0.028/mile, but typical redemptions are worth only €0.012/mile . Even with an 80% bonus (€0.016/mile), you need a high-value Business Class redemption to break even. Transfer partners are almost always better. On This Page The Math Problem with Buying Miles Current Purchase Pricing (Dec 2025) Better Alternatives: Transfer Partners When Buying CAN Make Sense When NOT to Buy Miles The Decision Framework The Math Problem with Buying Miles The fundamental issue is simple: miles typically cost more to buy than they are worth when redeemed. Here is the breakdown: Acquisition Method Cost Per Mile vs Baseline Value (€0.012) Result Standard purchase €0.028 2.3x higher ❌ 57% loss 80% bonus promo €0.016 1.3x higher ❌ 25% loss Subscribe to Miles €0.0125 ~Equal ⚠️ Break-even Transfer (with 25% bonus) €0.008 0.67x lower ✅ 50% profit Transfer (standard) €0.01 0.83x lower ✅ 20% profit The only way buying miles works is if your planned redemption has a value per mile that exceeds your purchase cost. For standard purchases, you would need redemptions worth €0.028+/mile. That is extremely rare outside of La Première. Current Purchase Pricing (December 2025) Flying Blue sells miles through their Miles Hub (powered by Points.com). The standard rate is 3.05 US cents per mile (approximately €0.028). Promotions offering 50 to 100% bonus miles reduce the effective cost. Purchase Option Price (USD) Effective CPM Assessment Standard (no promo) 3.05¢/mile €0.028 ❌ Never worth it 50% bonus 2.03¢/mile €0.019 ❌ Still too expensive 80% bonus (typical promo) 1.69¢/mile €0.016 ⚠️ Only for high-value redemptions 100% bonus (rare) 1.53¢/mile €0.014 ⚠️ Best promo, still marginal Subscribe to Miles 1.34¢/mile €0.0125 ✅ Best purchase option Pricing verified at Flying Blue Miles Hub . Last verified: 19 December 2025. ⚠️ Current Promo Check: Flying Blue regularly offers bonus promotions on miles purchases. Check the Flying Blue Miles Hub for current offers. An 80% bonus (1.69¢/mile effective) is considered average; 100% bonus (1.53¢) was last seen in 2022. Better Alternatives: Transfer Partners Before buying miles, consider transfer partners. If you have credit card points, transferring is almost always cheaper than purchasing. Flying Blue Transfer Partners (1:1 Ratio) American Express Membership Rewards Chase Ultimate Rewards Citi ThankYou Points Capital One Miles Bilt Rewards Wells Fargo Rewards All transfer 1:1 to Flying Blue. Transfer bonuses of 20 to 30% happen multiple times per year. Official info: KLM earning miles overview . Why Transfers Beat Purchases If you earn credit card points on everyday spending, your \"cost\" for those points is low. Example: 📊 Transfer vs Purchase Comparison Scenario: You need 60,000 miles for a Business Class award. Option A: Buy miles (80% bonus) Cost: $1,014 (60,000 miles at 1.69¢) Option B: Transfer from Amex (25% bonus) Need: 48,000 Amex points (becomes 60,000 with bonus) If earned on 2x category spend: €24,000 spending Effective cost: €0 incremental (points earned on spending you do anyway) Winner: Transfer, by a massive margin. 💡 Strategy: Never buy miles if you have transferable points available. Even without a bonus, transferring at 1:1 is cheaper than buying during an 80% promo. When Buying Miles CAN Make Sense ✅ Scenario 1: Small Top-Off for Specific Redemption You have 55,000 miles and need 60,000 for a Business Class award worth €2,000. Buying 5,000 miles at €80 (even at 1.69¢) makes sense because: 5,000 miles at €0.016 = €80 Your redemption value: €2,000 ÷ 60,000 = €0.033/mile You are paying €80 to unlock €2,000 in value ✅ Scenario 2: High-Value Business Class During Promo A Business Class ticket costs €3,500 cash. Award price is 60,000 miles + €200 taxes. With 80% bonus promo: 60,000 miles costs $1,014 (€943) Total: €943 + €200 = €1,143 vs €3,500 cash. Savings: €2,357 Value per mile: €3,300 ÷ 60,000 = €0.055. This exceeds purchase cost of €0.016. ✅ Scenario 3: Subscribe to Miles for Planned Redemption You need 17,000 miles to complete a booking. Subscribe to Miles for one month at Complete tier ($227.80 for 17,000 miles), book your award, then cancel. See Flying Blue Subscribe to Miles for current pricing. At 1.34¢/mile (€0.0125), this is cheaper than any promotional purchase. When NOT to Buy Miles ❌ Speculative Buying Buying miles \"just in case\" or because there is a promo is almost always a bad deal. Flying Blue award pricing can change without notice. Devaluations have happened before, which can reduce the value of purchased miles overnight. ❌ Economy Redemptions Economy awards typically yield €0.008 to 0.012 per mile. Even with an 80% bonus (€0.016/mile), you lose money. Just pay cash for Economy tickets. ❌ Standard (Non-Promo) Pricing At €0.028/mile, you would need redemptions worth more than 2x the baseline value. This is essentially impossible outside of La Première during peak season. Wait for at least a 50% bonus. ❌ When You Have Transfer Partners Available If yo",

      "description": "In Flying Blue, a",
      "content": "\" But in Flying Blue, miles do not determine your status . XP (Experience Points) do. Therefore, a Flying Blue member does an XP Run . The goal is not to fly far, but to earn the maximum number of XP for the lowest price. This often means flying shorter distances with more connections rather than one long direct flight. See Flying Blue: Status & XP for official programme context. The Golden Rule: More Legs = More XP This is the foundation of every successful XP run. Flying Blue awards XP per flight segment (leg) , not per trip or per mile. Why Connections Beat Direct Flights Direct flight: You earn XP once (for one leg). Connected flight: You earn XP twice (for two legs). Double connection: You earn XP three times (for three legs). Since connecting flights are often priced similarly (or even cheaper) than direct flights, adding a stopover is the easiest way to boost your status earnings by 50% or more. XP Earning by Distance and Cabin Before planning your run, understand how XP is calculated. The earning rate depends on two factors: flight distance and cabin class. Distance Band Economy Premium Business La Première Domestic (France) 2 XP 4 XP 6 XP 10 XP Medium haul (under 2000 mi) 5 XP 10 XP 15 XP 25 XP Long haul 1 (2000 to 3500 mi) 8 XP 16 XP 24 XP 40 XP Long haul 2 (3500 to 5000 mi) 10 XP 20 XP 30 XP 50 XP Long haul 3 (over 5000 mi) 12 XP 24 XP 36 XP 60 XP Official sources: KLM membership levels , Flying Blue Status & XP . Last verified: 19 December 2025. 💡 Key Insight: Business Class earns 3x more XP than Economy per leg. On short European flights, the price difference is often only 50 to 100 euros, but the XP difference is 10 XP (15 vs 5). This makes short haul Business the XP runner's best friend. The Power of Connections: Real Examples 📊 Example 1: Amsterdam to New York Option A: Direct Flight (Business) AMS → JFK: 30 XP (Long haul 2) Return: 30 XP Total: 60 XP Option B: Via Paris (Business) AMS → CDG: 15 XP (Medium haul) CDG → JFK: 30 XP (Long haul 2) Return legs: 15 + 30 = 45 XP Total: 90 XP Result: By changing planes in Paris, you earn 50% more XP for often the same price or less. 📊 Example 2: Amsterdam to Singapore Option A: Direct Flight (Business) AMS → SIN: 36 XP (Long haul 3) Return: 36 XP Total: 72 XP Option B: Via Paris (Business) AMS → CDG: 15 XP CDG → SIN: 36 XP Return legs: 15 + 36 = 51 XP Total: 102 XP Result: The Paris connection adds 30 XP to your trip. Three of these trips per year (306 XP) is enough for Platinum . The Antwerp Hack: The Train That Earns XP This is one of the most powerful XP run strategies, and many members do not know about it. 🚄 The Antwerp Run Explained KLM operates an Air&Rail service from Antwerp (station code: ZWE) and Brussels to Amsterdam Schiphol. When you book a flight that starts from Antwerp, the train ride counts as a flight segment and earns XP. The Magic: The train is classified as a \"Medium haul\" segment. In Economy: 5 XP per direction. In Business: 15 XP per direction. The Double Benefit: Flights from Antwerp or Brussels are often significantly cheaper than direct flights from Amsterdam, while earning more XP due to the extra segment. 📊 Example: The Antwerp Run to New York Standard booking from Amsterdam (Business) AMS → JFK: 30 XP Return: 30 XP Total: 60 XP Antwerp booking (Business) ZWE → AMS (train): 15 XP AMS → JFK: 30 XP Return: 30 + 15 = 45 XP Total: 90 XP Result: Same destination, 50% more XP, often a lower price. The \"cost\" is arriving at Antwerp Central Station instead of Schiphol. 📊 Example: Triple Stack (Antwerp + Paris Connection) Antwerp to New York via Paris (Business) ZWE → AMS (train): 15 XP AMS → CDG: 15 XP CDG → JFK: 30 XP Return: 30 + 15 + 15 = 60 XP Total: 120 XP Result: One round trip earns 120 XP. That is 40% of your entire Platinum requirement (300 XP) in a single booking. ⚠️ Important: The train segment only earns XP when booked as part of a KLM Air&Rail itinerary . Booking the train separately does not count. Understanding When to Do an XP Run Timing is everything. Your qualification year determines when XP runs make strategic sense. Your Qualification Year Structure: Runs from the 1st of a month to the last day of the month before, one year later (e.g., November 1 to October 31). Determined by: Your last level up to your current XP status. XP Expires: Any XP not used for status or rollover is lost when your year ends. Rollover Cap: Maximum 300 XP can carry over to the next year. Official references: KLM membership levels , Flying Blue T&C (PDF) . When an XP Run Makes Sense Close to a threshold: You have 250 XP and need 300 for Platinum. A targeted run closes the gap. Year ending soon: Your qualification year ends in 6 weeks and you will lose your progress without action. Strategic rollover: You want to hit 600 XP as Platinum so you roll over 300 XP and start next year already qualified. Soft landing prevention: You are Gold with 150 XP and your year ends next month. A run to 180 XP saves your status. When to Skip the XP",

      "description": "Flying Blue XP (Experience Points) determine your elite status with Air France and KLM. Learn exactly how XP works, earning rates by cabin class, and the thresholds for Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Ultimate status.",
      "content": "Unlike miles (which you spend on awards), XP accumulates from flights and determines whether you reach Silver (100 XP), Gold (180 XP), Platinum (300 XP), or Ultimate (900 UXP) status. When you reach each level, the required XP is deducted from your balance. XP resets annually but up to 300 XP can roll over to your next qualification year. How the XP System Works You start as an Explorer and must earn 100 XP to reach Silver status. The system deducts 100 XP from your balance immediately upon qualification. You keep only the surplus XP above that threshold to start your new cycle. You are now at the start of your Silver year. You need to earn a full 180 XP to reach Gold status. This is a fresh requirement, not the difference between Silver and Gold. The system deducts 180 XP once you upgrade to Gold. You then need to earn 300 XP to reach Platinum. For Ultimate , you need 900 UXP (earned only on AF/KL marketed flights) while holding Platinum. When you qualify, 900 UXP is deducted. XP vs Miles: Two Separate Currencies Flying Blue operates two distinct currencies. Confusing them is one of the most common mistakes new members make. Here is how they differ: Aspect Miles XP (Experience Points) Purpose Redeemable currency for awards Determines your status level Can you spend them? Yes: flights, upgrades, shopping No: status qualification only Expiration After 24 months of account inactivity Reset each qualification year (with rollover) Earning sources Flights, credit cards , partners, shopping Primarily flights + SAF purchases Transferable? Yes, to other Flying Blue accounts No ⚠️ Common misconception: Many members think spending miles or earning miles from credit cards helps their status. It does not. Only XP determines your status level from Explorer to Platinum. How Flying Blue XP is Earned XP earnings depend on two primary factors: flight distance and cabin class. Unlike Miles, XP earnings are not affected by your status level or the price of your ticket. Factor 1: Flight Distance Flying Blue uses distance bands rather than exact mileage. Longer flights earn proportionally more XP. Distance Band Economy Premium Business First Example Routes Domestic 2 XP 4 XP 6 XP 10 XP Toulouse to Paris (Orly) Medium-haul (<2000 mi) 5 XP 10 XP 15 XP 25 XP AMS to London, CDG to Istanbul Long-haul 1 (2000 to 3500 mi) 8 XP 16 XP 24 XP 40 XP AMS to Dubai, CDG to Montreal Long-haul 2 (3500 to 5000 mi) 10 XP 20 XP 30 XP 50 XP AMS to New York, CDG to Nairobi Long-haul 3 (5000+ mi) 12 XP 24 XP 36 XP 60 XP AMS to Tokyo, CDG to Los Angeles Official source: Flying Blue Status & XP . Rates may vary by airline and booking class. Last verified: 19 December 2025. ✈️ Important: First Class & Feeder Flights KLM does not offer a First Class cabin. First Class is exclusive to specific Air France long-haul routes (branded as La Premiere ). Insider Trick: If you book a La Premiere itinerary that involves a connection (e.g., AMS to Singapore via Paris), you earn First Class XP on the short feeder flight (AMS to CDG) as well. This applies even though you fly in Business Class on that specific leg and even if that leg is operated by KLM. Factor 2: Cabin Class Multiplier Your ticket class significantly impacts XP earned. This is why some frequent flyers specifically book Business Class for status runs : Economy: Base XP (1x) Premium Economy: 2x base XP Business Class: 3x base XP La Premiere (First): 5x base XP 📊 Real Example: A direct Amsterdam to New York round trip (Long-haul 2) in Business Class earns 60 XP (2 legs of 30 XP). 🚀 Expert Tip 1: The Power of Connections If you book the same trip via Paris (AMS to CDG to JFK), you earn for 4 flight segments instead of 2. AMS to CDG (Medium): 15 XP CDG to JFK (Long 2): 30 XP That is 45 XP one-way, or 90 XP total . You earn 50% more status points for often the same price (or less!). 🚄 Expert Tip 2: The \"Antwerp Run\" Prices from outstations (like Antwerp or Brussels) are often significantly cheaper than direct flights from hubs. This is a favorite strategy of \"XP Runners\" . The Hack: If you book Antwerp (ZWE) to Amsterdam to New York, the train ride from Antwerp to Schiphol counts as a flight segment! ZWE to AMS (Train in Business): 15 XP AMS to JFK (Long 2 in Business): 30 XP Total: 90 XP return plus potential savings on the ticket price. Additional XP Sources While flights are the primary source, you can earn bonus XP from: Flying Blue AMEX cards: 15 to 60 XP annually depending on card tier SAF contributions: Sustainable Aviation Fuel purchases earn bonus XP Promotional campaigns: Flying Blue periodically offers double XP on specific routes Flying Blue Status Thresholds Here are the exact XP requirements for each status level.

      "content": "R Remco de Graaf Founder, SkyStatus Pro · Flying Blue Platinum Creator of SkyStatus Pro, a Flying Blue analytics tool used by 140+ members to track XP, rollover, and miles value. Flying Blue member since 2005, the year the program launched from the merger of KLM's Flying Dutchman and Air France's Fréquence Plus. After two decades in the program, I've held every status level from Silver to Platinum as travel patterns shifted between business trips and family holidays. That's not a weakness. It's why I understand the program from every angle. LinkedIn Profile 20+ Years in Flying Blue 15+ Mileage Runs Completed 50+ Countries Visited 2025 SkyStatus Launched Why I Built SkyStatus For years, I tracked my Flying Blue progress in spreadsheets. XP earned per flight. Miles from credit cards. Rollover calculations. Cost-per-mile analysis. It worked, but it was tedious, and I knew I wasn't the only one doing this. The official Flying Blue app shows your current balance, but it doesn't answer the questions I actually cared about: How many XP do I need, and when does my qualification year end? What's my cost-per-mile across all earning sources? If I do a mileage run to Barcelona, will I make Gold before February? How much of my XP will roll over if I don't requalify? SkyStatus Pro answers all of these. I built the tool I always wanted, and now it's available for everyone who's serious about optimizing their Flying Blue journey. SkyStatus is built on a complete analytical model of the Flying Blue program , reconstructed from official rules and real-world data, and extended with projections and ROI insights Flying Blue itself does not provide. My Background By day, I work in the Dutch tech media industry, where I've spent 30 years building digital products and explaining complex topics in accessible ways. That experience shapes how SkyStatus works: data-driven, privacy-focused, and designed for people who want to understand the math behind their miles. I fly for both business and leisure. This ranges from short hops within Europe to long-hauls to Asia and the Americas. I've done early-morning mileage runs to rack up XP before year-end, and I've carefully calculated whether buying miles makes sense for a specific redemption. (Spoiler: it usually doesn't.) This combination of loyalty program experience and product development is why SkyStatus exists. It's not a corporate product. It's built by someone who actually uses it. Why You Can Trust SkyStatus 👤 Built by a Member Created by a 20-year Flying Blue member who uses it for his own status tracking. 📐 Based on Official Rules Calculations follow Flying Blue's published earning and qualification rules. ⚠️ Clear Limitations We tell you when calculations are estimates and always recommend verification. 🚫 No Affiliation Independent tool.
