<h2>What Subscribe to Miles is and is not</h2>

<ul>
  <li>✔ A predictable way to acquire miles monthly</li>
  <li>✔ Useful if you need miles gradually for a known redemption</li>
  <li>✘ Not a status accelerator</li>
  <li>✘ No XP or elite credits included</li>
  <li>✘ Not automatically good value</li>
</ul>

<h2>Is €0.011 per mile good value</h2>

<p>
  A cost of approximately <strong>€0.011 per mile</strong> is neither cheap nor expensive by Flying Blue standards.
  Whether this makes sense depends entirely on how the miles are redeemed.

<h2>Bottom line</h2>

<p>
  Subscribe to Miles is not a hack and not a loyalty shortcut.
  It is a budgeting tool.
</p>

<p>
  At €0.011 per mile, it only makes sense if you redeem for high-value awards
  such as Business Class Promo Rewards.
  For Economy redemptions, this subscription usually destroys value.
